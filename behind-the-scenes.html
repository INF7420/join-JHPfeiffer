        <p>There was once a young mom who lived in a town that she did not grow up in or work in.  She only lived there for a short time when she made the decision to become a stay at home mother.  This mom became very sad and lonely and felt trapped at home with a colicy infant.  She missed her co-workers and her professional life, so she started to look for opportunities for herself and her child.  This turn out to be a very difficult task but she finally located a dated news article about a local mothers group.  It took her several months to build up her confidence to attend a meeting, she even did a couple drive-bys.  Finally, the day came when she made herself walk through the door and attend her first meeting.  It was on this day her whole life changed!  Suddenly, she was surrounded by other parents who knew about playgroups, story times, and kid events.  This mom met other mothers who became her friends, she joined the parent group, and she started going to other events in her area.  This young mother started to feel happy, she did not feel trapped at home anymore, and she started to enjoy motherhood.</p>

        <p>This young mom knew that other parents were feeling like she had and wanted to reach out to them.  She decided that she needed to create a website that informed parents in the Great Lakes Bay Region of the wealth of resources available to them.  Six years later this mom continues to reach out to other parents with the hope that she can help them find the resources they need in those lonely early years.</p>
